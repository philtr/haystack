# üöú Haystack

Haystack is a powerful tmux-based process management tool designed for
streamlining development environments. It allows you to easily manage multiple
processes defined in a Procfile, providing a clean and efficient interface for
monitoring and controlling your development stack.

Haystack was designed to be a relatively drop-in replacement for the `bin/dev`
that ships with [Ruby on Rails][rails].

## Features

- **Procfile Support**: Easily start and manage multiple processes defined in a
  Procfile.
- **Tmux Integration**: Utilizes tmux for efficient terminal multiplexing and
  process management.
- **Colorized Output**: Each process output is uniquely colored for easy
  differentiation.
- **Combined Log View**: View all process logs in a single, combined window.
- **Environment Variable Support**: Automatically loads environment variables
  from `.env` files.
- **Easy Navigation**: Use Alt+[number] to quickly switch between process
  windows.
- **One-Command Shutdown**: Gracefully stop all processes with a single key
  combination (Ctrl+Q).
- **Self-Update Mechanism**: Easily update Haystack to the latest version with a
  simple command.

## Requirements

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **TL;DR**: You need bash, tmux, curl, sed, and sort installed on your system.

- For macOS: `brew install tmux curl coreutils`
- For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install tmux curl`

---

To use Haystack effectively, you need to have the following installed on your
system:

1. **Bash**: Haystack is a Bash script and requires a Bash shell to run. Most
   Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) have Bash installed by default.

2. **tmux**: Haystack relies heavily on tmux for process management and
  interface creation. Make sure you have tmux installed and accessible from your
  command line.
   - On macOS: You can install tmux using Homebrew with `brew install tmux`
   - On Ubuntu/Debian: Install using `sudo apt-get install tmux`
   - On other systems: Check your package manager or the [tmux GitHub
   page](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for installation instructions.

3. **curl**: Used for downloading updates. It comes pre-installed on most
  systems, but if you don't have it:
   - On macOS: It should be pre-installed. If not, you can install it with
   Homebrew: `brew install curl`
   - On Ubuntu/Debian: Install using `sudo apt-get install curl`

4. **sed**: Used for text processing. It's typically pre-installed on Unix-like systems.

5. **sort**: Used for version comparison. The GNU version of sort with `-V`
  option is preferred. It's typically pre-installed on Linux  systems.
   - On macOS: The default `sort` might not support `-V`. You can install GNU
   coreutils (which includes `gsort`) with Homebrew: `brew install coreutils`

### Compatibility

Haystack is designed to work on Unix-like operating systems, including:

- Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)
- macOS
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Windows users should use WSL or a Unix-like environment to run Haystack.

## Installation

1. Download the Haystack script:

   ```sh
   curl -o bin/haystack https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philtr/haystack/main/haystack
   ```

1. Make the script executable:

   ```sh
   chmod +x bin/haystack
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to your project directory containing a Procfile.

1. Run Haystack:

   ```sh
   bin/haystack
   ```

   By default, Haystack looks for a file named `Procfile.dev`. If you want to
   use a different Procfile, specify it as an argument:

   ```sh
   bin/haystack Procfile.local
   ```

1. Haystack will start all processes defined in your Procfile within a tmux session.

1. Use the following commands within the Haystack session:
   - `Alt+[number]`: Switch to a specific process window
   - `Alt+1`: View the combined log output
   - `Ctrl+Q`: Gracefully shut down all processes and exit Haystack

## Updating Haystack

Haystack can be updated using the following commands:

- `bin/haystack --update`: Checks for updates and installs a new version if
  available.
- `bin/haystack --update --force`: Forces an update to the latest version, even
  if it's not newer than the current version.

## Configuration

Haystack uses the following files for configuration:

- `Procfile.dev` (or the specified Procfile): Defines the processes to run.
- `.env.development` or `.env`: Defines environment variables for your processes.
